								<div class="col-lg-5"><p div class="About">
								Dead Man's Bones is a rock duo consisting of actor Ryan 
								Gosling and his friend Zach Shields. Their first album, Dead Man's Bones, was 
								released on 6 October 2009 through ANTI-Records. The entire album is a collaboration 
								with the Silverlake Conservatory Children's Choir, started by Red Hot Chili Peppers 
								bassist Flea, from Los Angeles, California. Gosling performs under the alias "Baby Goose".

								<br></br>

								When Shields and Gosling met in 2005 they discovered a mutual obsession with ghosts and decided 
								to write love stories about ghosts and monsters. The pair chose to play all the instruments on the 
								record, even those they had never touched before. They also imposed rules on themselves during the 
								recording process, such as not playing with a click track, and trying to do no more than three takes 
								on any song, letting any imperfections highlight the strengths of the music.

								Record label: ANTI<br>
								Members: Ryan Gosling and Zach Shields<br>

								<p div class="About">

								Integral to the creation of Dead Man's Bones was the 
								pair's motivation to keep things as raw and real as 
								possible, stripped down to reveal even the limitations 
								of their musicianship. When it came time to record the 
								album, Gosling and Shields created a set of White Stripes-esque
								 rules to follow so as to not taint the purity of the process. 
								 Rules like no click tracks or electric guitars, no more than 
								 three takes, and playing all of the instruments themselves (along 
								 with producer Tim Anderson of Ima Robot). Gosling played cello and 
								 piano for the first time, while Shields took up the drums. Their 
								 desire to work under these conditions stemmed from bad music industry 
								 experiences in the past.
								 </p>

								<div class="col-lg-4">
								<p div class="About">
								"We had both made music before, and both of us hated what we did," 
								Shields said. "We worked with people who were super professional, 
								really accomplished musicians. And I always felt-- I think Ryan felt 
								the same way-- everyone I was working with, I was trying to step up to 
								their level and be as good as they were, technically. When we recorded before, 
								everyone we worked with, they tried to make us good, and you know, we're not, 
								we're amateurs. They would put it through a click track, have us do a million takes, 
								Auto-Tune my voice because I can't sing well."
								</p>
								</div>

								<div class="col-lg-4">
								<p div class="About">
								Gosling's singing also suffered under the weight of conventional studio expectations. 
								On the Dead Man's Bones album, Shields' indie-everyman voice complements Gosling's more 
								mannered tone, which exhibits a bit of Roy Orbison (or, some might say, Bryan Ferry) tremolo. 
								However, encouraging Gosling to display his natural talent wasn't all that easy. Shields explained, 
								"I'd hear him do karaoke, or when he thinks nobody's listening, like he's in the other room singing, 
								with his natural voice, when he's singing and nobody's listening, it has this old quality, like this 
								50s kind of croonery feel. Every time I would hear him singing, without trying to sound like anything, 
								that's how he sings. So we were trying to record one session, and they were trying to make us both sound so 
								modern, which he doesn't. I was like, 'You know, you should just sing in your natural voice,' and they kind of 
								made fun of us. They were like, 'Oh that's goofy, that's silly.'"
